# Famous Pong game on ESP8266
Collage project, which I had so much fun dealing with. Created using ESP8266 and Arduino IDE. Fully portable, since it's powered by 4 AA batteries.
Special thanks to **vijju27**, who is responsible for most of the game's code and to **olikraus**, creator of the [U8g2lib](https://github.com/olikraus/u8g2) library used in the project.
